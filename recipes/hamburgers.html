                <p>
                    It couldn't be easier to grill hamburger patties! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of 
                    what you can expect: 
                </p>
                
                <ul> 

                    <li > Prepare the grill grate by cleaning it and brushing it lightly with oil. Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat, </li>

                    <li> then grill the patties on each side (the length of time depends on the level of doneness you're after). </li>

                    <li> If you're making cheeseburgers, add a slice of cheese about a minute before the burger is finished. </li>

                </ul>

                <h3> What Temperature Is a Hamburger Done? </h3>

                    <p> Hamburger patties are done when a food thermometer inserted into the center reaches 160 degrees F. </p>

                <h3> How Long to Grill Hamburgers </h3>
                    
                    <p> 
                        The only way to ensure that illness-causing bacteria has been destroyed is to make sure a food thermometer inserted 
                        into the center of the meat reaches 160 degrees F. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This recipe calls for about 4-5 minutes of grilling time on each side — that should get you into the safe-zone 
                        (you can use a thermometer to make sure).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rare and medium-rare burgers will be ready more quickly, but they are a bit riskier when it comes to foodborne illness.
