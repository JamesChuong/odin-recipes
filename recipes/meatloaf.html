            <p> 
                In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, this classic meatloaf should be fully cooked in about one hour. 
                You'll know it's done when the meat is no longer pink in the center.

        <h2> What Temperature Is Meatloaf Done? </h2>
            
            <p> 
                Use an instant read thermometer, inserted into the middle, to check the doneness of the meatloaf. It's 
                completely cooked and safe to eat at 160 degrees F.
